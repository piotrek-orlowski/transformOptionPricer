Description: The package allows for efficient calculation of certain European-
    style derivatives (call options, digital options) via transform methods. The
    code is fully vectorized in the following dimensions: strike range, maturity,
    state variable value (for stochastic volatility models). The user has to pass
    a characteristic function evaluator as an argument to the transform pricers.
    By default, the package affineModelR, which implements a wide range of jump-
    diffusion specifications in fast c++ code, is used as the characteristic
    function back-end.
